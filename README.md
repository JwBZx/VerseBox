Welcome to VerseBox!

VerseBox is a simple JavaScript Application that stores all of the Bible Verses I have in my real life Verse Box!
In this app, you can view the Verses my accountability partner Justin has given me to memorize, or you can view the verses I have gotton from 7-9, a Bible Study group I am in!
That is pretty much the jist of this app. It's basically just a way for me to store all of the Bible Verses I have been given to memorize.

If you have any ideas, comments, suggestions, or anything else of that nature, feel free to open up an issue!
If you want to mess with the code yourself, you are always free to fork the project and work on it yourself!

Thank You for checking out this application! I hope you like it!

Thank You and God Bless!
